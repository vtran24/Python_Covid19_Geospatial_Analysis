# Monitoring Critical Trends in COVID-19 Pandemic Through Geospatial Analysis
## Background
Data Analysis with the continuously updating information on confirmed case and death reports encourage policymakers, health officials, as well as the general public to better visualize the spread of the virus across counties in order to identify potential patterns and enforce practices to help minimize the spread. 
Visualizations are crucial as it helps state and city leadership better manage the toll of the spread in their respective areas. It allows counties to be identify other communities that might need supplies or support and also be prepare if there's an increasing amount of cases in their own areas.
